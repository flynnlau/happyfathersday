	<p class="fragment"> Dear Grandpa, <br> <br>

Happy Father’s Day. I can’t can tell how appreciative I am that you have been so engaged with my life and my growing interests throughout the years. I remember sitting with you at the kitchen tables in Ocracoke and West Virginia watching you play solitaire because I wanted to learn to play just like you did. You folded me into your game so easily, explaining your moves and giving me confidence that those would be moves I would think of someday soon. You’ve stayed with me through the riskier things as well. Once, just after I had gotten my liscense, I rolled through a stopsign with you in the car. I remember you turned to me and said stop doesnt stand for step toe on petal, you really have to come to a stop! I think about those words every time I come upon a stop sign a little to quickly, haha. All to say, the little moments we’ve shared have really stayed with me. I’m so excited to see you and Grandma so soon.

Love,
Margaret </p>
