	<p class="fragment"> Dear Grandpa, <br>
<br>
Happy father’s, grandfather’s, great-grandfather’s day! It has been so special to see you interacting with Alys, passing on the same curiosity about life and passion for building, taking things apart and learning new things that you’ve shared with all of us grandchildren. I love to see the two of you together, and to imagine you with your Grandfather and feel connected to our history as a family. I think of it especially when Alys is holding a gumball, ever since you shared that story about your grandfather cheering you up amongst the gumball trees. Alys reminds me of you in his fearlessness and sometimes in his mischievousness too! Andy, Alys and I are all so lucky to share our family and time and stories with you. We can’t wait to see you and Grandma in August! 
<br> <br>
Love,
Lauren </p>
