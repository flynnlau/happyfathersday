	<p class="fragment"> Hey Grandpa, <br>
<br>

      I hope these notes find you well. I am very grateful to call you my grandfather. Whether it be chopping down a tree in West Virginia, rebuilding the transmission in the 55, or driving cross country for the first time, I have learned a lot from you over the years. These are all important skills but the thing that has stood out to me the most during these times is the no quit, can do attitude you bring to any endeavor. It’s cool to have a grandpa that’s still working hard, learning, and getting better everyday. Hope you enjoy Father’s Day and your visit to Virginia! Looking forward to seeing you and Grandma in August!
