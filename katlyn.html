	<p class="fragment"> 1 Our house is alive with robins this morning. 

2 There is a group studding the lilac bushes. They are spaced perfectly from one another like big orange christmas ornaments. I wonder why they don’t huddle together for warmth. 

3 A few brave birds risk the wind and fly up to the hackberry tree to eat the tiny berries. A thin layer of sweet flesh coats the big round seeds of the hackberries, a last-resort sustenance of early spring. 

4 The wind tore them apart.

5 Others huddle near our house by the doors and windows where the heat is escaping, and in the southeast corner where the wall blocks the wind. When they do fly, they are blown about along with the snow and my scarf. 

6 The wind makes topological patterns on the surface of the snow. 

7 Bird poop fills the porches, concentrated along the seams between house and porch, and around each door. 

8 Some robins are worrying the finches who nest in our attic, but no one is squawking. I assume the situation is relatively peaceful.

9 I am waiting for the weather to change. It is spring and it’s going to rain. 

10 I am not excessively hungry as the world promised. I am just tired.

11 Andy eats mango flesh off the pit. He is reminded, at first pleasantly and then unpleasantly, of eating a chicken wing.

12 Melt, melt, melt.

13 An old man at the bus stop asks, “Have you heard the weather lately?”

14 The sun is shining. He wants to assess the extent of his joy.

15 I let the weather play some determining role in my actions every day.

16 I honor it by listening and attempting to act accordingly.

17 He will need to be taught to move gently through the world with love and care. There will be times and places for quiet and times and places for exuberance.

18 The ants are still alive. 

18.5 Nothing has been done about them.

19 My mother tells me that her grandmother kept an enormous bowl of flour out on the counter covered with a cloth. 

20 When it came time to make biscuits, she would pour the wet ingredients right into the flour bowl, mix them into the flour until the dough was the right consistency, pull the dough out onto the counter and cover the bowl for the future. 

21 With eleven children, maybe this happened every day.

22 This is what comes to mind when I ask myself what can be gleaned from the habits and dreams of my ancestors. I’m not sure why. 

23 It is not only the rhythm, but the willingness to let things mingle and the skills to navigate the edges between them. 

24 How do I imagine a future with the help of the past?

25 Sometimes in my dreams I am a little boy. These must be Alÿs’s dreams.

26 "An installation is an artistic happening but it is also a prophecy, the fulfillment of a reminder of close memory, the proposal (the reading method) which turns a discovery of shapes into an aesthetic rethinking of urban conceptions.”

27 How many times is it worthwhile to enter a new city?

28 I dreamt that I parked a car illegally in a Spanish speaking city. My car, a Toyota Avalon, was towed. I spent the dream trying to figure out where towed cars end up in this foreign city. 

29 That morning, I'd parked the car in the covered lot of a restaurant and bar. 

30 The restaurant must have had my car towed. In the place of the parking spots that welcomed me that morning, there was an outdoor seating area where people were watching soccer and drinking together. 

31 If art and politics are forces that inevitably, and unpredictably, restructure the sensible, how do we practice both in a way that orients the world better, more carefully, less violently?

32 They gave me food, and the customers gladly helped speculate as to the location of my car.

33 I must have found it because I drove home, to the house of the people who’d lent me the car, in the wee hours of the morning with daylight breaking over a long long bridge. It took more than an hour to cross the bridge.

34 Now I am eating breakfast alone, and I am hungry and full all at once. 

36 As I congratulate myself, I eat the grapefruit faster.

37 As Andy and I walked from my studio to the coop, I found two purple combs. One was whole and one just fragments. I doubted my decision to pick up the dirty, intact comb until we came upon the second.

38 Its appearance validated the collection of the first. 

39 Several blocks later there was a spiky orange tangle, maybe a piece of a plastic broom. It was mostly teeth, just like the combs, so I picked that up as well. 

40 Lately, I am two people: one who can live outside my body and one who cannot.

41 If we clean out our closet, we may find our umbrella.

42 But we don’t find it. The wind tore it apart.

43 It is freed up to become something else.

44 The snow melted. All that is left of the bird poop is the big round pits of the hackberries.  They fill the seams between house and porch and around each door.
