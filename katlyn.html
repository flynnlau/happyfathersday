	<p class="fragment"> Dear Grandpa, <br> <br> 

Happy Grandfather’s Day! I can’t believe that it has been over a year since I’ve seen you and Grandma in person. I think that all of my memories with you and the life lessons that I have learned from you have made the time apart not feel as long. I channeled your boldness tackling projects when I decided to start my sewing projects with the advanced pattern, and I thought back to West Virginia when building fires in my backyard this winter to keep friends warm. I’m so looking forward to seeing you and grandma next week!

<br> <br>
Love,
Katlyn </p>
